## Artificial Intelligence Tasks 

This repository contains three AI tasks to be submitted to CODSOFT. Below are the details of each task:

## Task 1: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

## Task 2: TIC-TAC-TOE AI

Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

## Task 3: RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.
